# DNS Resolver

I wrote a basic DNS stub resolver in C for a university course. A skeleton of the resolver was provided, but I implemented the key features:

- encoding/decoding the DNS query and response
- sending and receiving the UDP packets

*I have chosen not to publish the code for my DNS resolver in order to prevent misuse by future students of the same course.*
