# os345

os345 is a basic, simulated operating system written in C that I created as a semester-long university project. A skeleton of the operating system and each of its features was provided, but I implemented the following:

- basic shell
- semaphores (counting and binary)
- virtual memory address translation
- fair-share task scheduling (using a custom priority queue implementation)
- FAT-12 file management operations

*I have chosen not to publish the code for os345 in order to prevent misuse by future students of the same course.*
