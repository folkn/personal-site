# Tiny Shell

Tiny Shell is a basic bash-style shell written in C that I created for a university course. A skeleton of the shell, as well as command parsing, was provided, but I implemented the following:

- input and output redirection
- pipes
- job control
- background processes
- signal handling

*I have chosen not to publish the code for Tiny Shell in order to prevent misuse by future students of the same course.*
