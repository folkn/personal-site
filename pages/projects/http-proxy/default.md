# HTTP Proxy

I wrote a basic proxy for HTTP `GET` requests in C for a university course. A skeleton of the proxy was provided, but I implemented the key features:

- receiving, parsing, and forwarding `GET` requests and responses
- using threads, semaphores, and I/O multiplexing to handle concurrent requests
- adding and modifying HTTP headers on `GET` requests

*I have chosen not to publish the code for my HTTP proxy in order to prevent misuse by future students of the same course.*
